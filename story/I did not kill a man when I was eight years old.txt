My stepfather hated everything my mother loved.Not just me, or her hobbies, and hell, probably himself too, but everything that made her happy.But Apollo he hated more than anything.I was five when me and mom got Apollo, a skinny skittish puppy at the time.He was patient with me - toddlers aren't always nice - but he worshipped mom.The little I remember of that time was happiness.I was seven when that man moved in.He didn't tolerate happiness in the house.He kicked Apollo for being 'too loud', and soon kicked me as well.After almost losing a finger, he learned not to hit us when Apollo was there.If he had known that I had noticed that he feared the dog, he would have beat me for noticing.He hated weakness, and it was always someone else's fault if he didn't like how he was feeling.After a while, he started ordering me to herd Apollo into another room and close the door when he wanted to beat my mother.Apollo would bark, howl and claw the door when it happened - the neighbours called animal protection three times, but never called the police.Some dogs can open doors.Apollo wasn't one of them.I did not kill a man when I was eight years old.All I did was open a door.
