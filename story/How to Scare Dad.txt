My father is the scariest man I’ve ever known and when armed with a bottle of beer he reaches nightmare levels.Just the crackle of his belt or rise in his voice was enough to make me shake like a leaf.One night, while I struggled to get comfortable in bed from the bruises and sounds of my mom’s crying, I hatched an ingenious idea to stop the pain and suffering: scare dad.Clearly he just didn’t know how his actions made us feel, but if I scared him like he scared us, maybe then he would change his ways.I tried anything I could think of to produce some fright and scare dad straight.I would hide and jump out at him, but he didn’t even flinch.I placed a toy snake in the toilet, but that only resulted in a beating for me.Finally, I thought of destroying his alcohol.I know that people become scared when they lose something they love, so one by one I poured my dad’s bottles down the drain and eagerly awaited his reaction.I knew this would be it, this would be the thing to scare him!That night, I remember my father discovering the empty bottles and becoming angrier than I’ve ever seen him.I remember him wrecking the house.I remember him storming into my room.I remember his hands around my neck and me seeing black.Luckily, my planning and hard work that night paid off though! Today, my father lives in a constant state of fear.I’m always watching him, how timid and nervous he is at all times.Whenever I pay him a visit his complexion turns a pasty white, his body shivers like I used to and he breaks into a cold sweat.I scared my father so good, you would think he saw a ghost.
