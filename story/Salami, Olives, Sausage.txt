There was nothing special about the pizza place where I worked.It offered your run-of-the-mill dough, strategically covered in enough grease to trick your mind into thinking it actually tasted good.There was nothing glamorous about the job.I didn't get to make great discoveries or save lives, but it was a job that paid the bills.BillsMy rent was due tomorrow.My gut clenched, reminding me of my account balance.My tips tonight would determine if I would be paying it on time or not.I barely heard the screen chime as an online order came in.One small pizza with salami, olives, and sausages.Simple enough, I thought.I created the artery killing monster and gave it to the delivery driver, Karl.He glanced down at the address and scoffed.'19 South Street? That's like, two blocks away.Lazy bastard couldn't just walk over for it?''Hey, delivery gives better tips.Remember you owe me half.' I said and wondered if the desperation came through in my voice.Karl turned and waved a hand in the air, like a child waving off a nagging mother trying to remind her son to wash behind his ears.He wasn't gone ten minutes before he was back, pizza box still in his hand.'Lazy bastard didn't even answer the door.I tried calling, no answer.Wanna split it?'I eyed the pizza.As sick of I was of it, I had barely eaten today.'Yeah, sure.''What was on it?''Uhâ€¦.Salami, olives, and sausages.''Eww, never mind.It's all yours.'I shrugged and broke the seal on the box.It was a sticker that promised and lied about using only fresh ingredients.I took a bit into the first piece.It was salty, the toppings an overwhelming choice.It felt good in my stomach, filling me up more than my lunch of ramen had.As I walked home that night, the pizza wasn't setting quite as well as it has been.Too much junk, I told myself, not enough food.My stomach turned harder when I saw the flashing lights ahead of me, five police cars, and an ambulance in front of a small house.My walking slowed as I got closer.A group of people had gathered around the police tape, warded off by the force field of yellow and black lines.I walked to the nearest group of people and motioned towards the house with a nod of my head.An old lady near me sighed.'Boyfriend held his girlfriend hostage inside, snapped, and killed her when she tried to escape.God rest her soul, she was just a young thing.'I looked back at the crime scene, noticing the house number beneath a smear of blood.My breath caught in my throat and I struggled not to choke.My eyes watered.19 South Street.The same house that had ordered the pizza.Salami.Olives.Sausage.
