My girlfriend moved out three weeks ago.My cat, Ruk, was really close to her and now that she's gone, I can tell he's a bit lonely.Especially when I'm at work.I came home a few times to my curtains ripped up, or all the toilet paper in shreds.The last straw was when I came home after working late to find he had clawed a hole the size of a dinner plate into the side of the sofa.I decided I had to do something.I tried different toys, even catnip, but nothing worked.One night while browsing Amazon, I saw a pet camera.It's a tiny camera that records your pet on a live feed so you can monitor their behavior while you're away.It even has an audio function so you can talk to them.Sounded silly but hey, I love my furry dude so I bought it.I got overnight shipping and installed it immediately.I decided to set it up in my bedroom, as that was where Ruk dwelled most.My first day at work I think I checked that camera thirty times.When I spoke into the microphone, Ruk seemed to be happier, and I noticed there was no destruction around the house either.By day four I figured I'd solved the problem with Ruk.That leads me to right now.About thirty minutes ago I climbed in bed with Ruk, ready to close my eyes, when my phone buzzed.A notification from the pet cam.I almost ignored it, sure I'd just triggered the thing.But I opened it anyway.What I saw made my grip tighten on the phone.Instead of a video of myself in bed I saw a man, tall, gangly, with pale skin, and large eyes.He was moving into my room with exaggerated steps, like a sneaking cartoon character.He got right up to the lens, so close I could almost smell his rotten breath, and he smiled.I immediately paused the video, terrified.I looked at the spot where the man should have been standing, but there was no one there.I went onto Amazon and found the pet cam, and read the reviews, hoping for some weird glitch.It had to be a joke, right? The first dozen reviews were pretty standard, but it was the last that caused me to bolt upright.The customer complained that the camera was on a time delay, sometimes as much as fifteen minutes.I went back to the video and pressed play with shaky fingers.I watched in horror as the man slithered under my bed, giving the camera a wink before disappearing in the darkness.Then I saw myself enter the room and climb in bed before the video ended.Now I'm sitting in my bed, knowing he's under it.I could call the police, but I doubt I'd have timeâ€¦.So please, do yourselves a favor and read the reviews.
