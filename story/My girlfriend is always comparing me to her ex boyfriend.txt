So I (36m) have been been with my girlfriend Chloe (35f) for the last 2 years.We are in a really happy relationship and I have even considered marrying her in the near future.The only issue I have with her is that she is constantly comparing me to her ex boyfriend Mark.It is really annoying and it is kinda starting to hurt my feelings.If I ever do something wrong then she would always point out that Mark wouldn't have made that mistake.I know that they were childhood sweethearts and were together for over ten years, but I really think she needs to stop doing this.She always gives me the silent treatment afterwards when I ask her to stop, which always make me feel like I did something wrong.It is really started to get on my nerves so I decided to organise a meeting between the 3 of us and make her choose which of us she wants.I knew she would be home late on Sunday evening so I decided that was the perfect day for the meeting.Me and Mark were sitting at the kitchen table when she walked in.I could see the look of shock on her face when she saw him.She fainted to the ground and I knew that she wanted Mark.I decided I would stand aside and let them be together.I placed Mark's rotting corpse back into his grave and then carefully lowered Chloe on top of him, before closing the coffin.I started throwing the dirt on top of the grave so that noone would ever know it was disturbed.I could hear Chloe's screams of what I assume were joy as she was finally reunited with the love of her life.I felt horrible that we were breaking up but didn't want to stand in the way of true love
