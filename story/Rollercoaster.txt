'Mooooom, I don't like it.I want to get off!'I was a bit surprised.He had always been so brave.I was way more afraid than him when we got on.I never liked to be so high up from the ground.'This will be so much fun!', he had said when we were parking the car.I had kinda hoped he would be strong for both of us.'Oh honey, I'm sorry but we can't get off now, the ride has already started.But remember the small rollercoaster, in the park we went to when you were little? With the funny clown? This is just like that, only bigger.And remember how AWESOME it was?'My son looked at me with watery eyes.Oh god.He had been so excited about this.I tried to swallow my own nervousness and keep talking to calm him down.My voice was shaking a bit, but I managed to put on a smile.'It's okay, it's okay.You might feel a bit funny in your stomach.It's because of the speed and the changes in the force that pushes you.It's normal! Listen, do you hear? Other people are scared too.'He looked at me with his kind, blue eyes and nodded.Just barely.I wanted to hug him, but my back was pressing to the seat so heavily I couldn't move enough.So was his.My eyes caught a glimpse of the sun over my sons head.The sky was so bright.I tried to ignore the metallic clanging sound and people screaming somewhere that seemed to be so far away.Oh, how I missed the ground.Then I felt a big drop on my stomach.We were going faster and faster.My son started sobbing and I tightened my grib on his hand.I thought that he would become such a handsome man someday.He would end up having a good life, and marry a nice girl - or a guy, who knows? I didn't care as long as he was happy.That's all I wanted.For him to be happy and not scared.'Hey, you know what? Close your eyes.This will be over soon.I'm here.I'm not letting go.'Someone behind us started to scream.I felt my blood run cold.I tried to keep my focus on the one thing that mattered: my sons hand and my calm voice that kept telling him that it was all going to be okay.Oh, he would become such a handsome man someday.But at this moment he was just a 6 year old boy on his first flight, going to surprise his grandparents all the way across the country.And the last thing I saw before I closed my own eyes, was the second engine on fire.
