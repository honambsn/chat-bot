It was every family's nightmare.My wife and I had the day off work, and we had taken our son out for lunch and some family bonding time.But as we approached our home, something felt off.I had a growing sense of dread the closer we got.As our house came into view, I could see that the front door was wide open.Someone had broken into our home.I told my family to wait outside, in case the intruder was still inside.They obliged, and I slowly and silently made my way through our house.As I stepped into the living room, I saw broken furniture, nothing in its correct place, just utter chaos.Was this person looking for something? Did they have malicious intent? Why our home? Why us?Next, I walked to our kitchen.The fridge had been emptied.Dishes and food were thrown all over the room.What kind of person had broken into our home? A homeless person who just needed food? If so, why had they destroyed the living room?That's when I heard it.Footsteps in the bedroom.The intruder was still in our house.I took a brief moment to be grateful that I had asked my wife and son to wait outside.It was impossible to decipher this person's motives so far.But I was about to come face to face with the person that forcefully entered our home.And I would demand answers.I crept toward the bedroom slowly, slowly.I approached the door, and focused on the sliver of light slipping through the crack.I could see faint shadows dancing in the light.I raised my hand, placed it against the door, and took a deep breath, readying myself for whatever may be on the other side.I pushed the door open and stepped through the threshold with authority.I couldn't believe my eyes.I actually rubbed my hands over them, thinking I was imagining things.There, in my son's bed, was a young girl with curly blonde hair.She stared at me with wide eyes.She must have been terrified.I must have been a few feet taller and at least 100 pounds heavier than her.I must have been a sight to see for that little girl.But she should have considered that before breaking into my home.I called my wife and son to see what I found.'Is that a human, Papa?''Why yes it is, Baby Bear.That's dinner.'
