Title: Short Scary Stories

Story:Upon finding a small collection of short stories online, a man is immediately intrigued by their high ratings and comments praising them as 'terrifying' and 'mind-blowing'.Deciding to see what the fuss was about, he began to read the first one.It was a story about a family who had recently moved into a new house.Something about it seemed off, and one by one each family member began to discover 'the secret of the house'.However, instead of revealing what the secret was, the story simply stated 'but that's a story for another day' before moving on to the next paragraph.Curious, yet slightly annoyed, the man went to the comments to see if the author had written a sequel.He found only one comment stating 'this story is amazing! I can't wait for the next one!'Somehow, the comment was dated 4 years ago.Despite seeing no evidence that the story had been continued, the man decided to move onto the next story, determined to discover the house's secret.On the second story, a group of friends were on a road trip when they discovered an abandoned town.They noticed eerie statues in each building, of people in various states of fear and panic.Creeped out, the friends decided they would leave early in the morning and never speak of the town again.However, as one of them turned to leave, they thought they saw one of the statues move out of the corner of their eye.The story then ended with 'but that's a story for another day'.The man was now both unnerved and frustrated, and was starting to regret his decision to read the stories.He could already tell that this third story was going to be no different.In it, a young girl was working the graveyard shift at a 24-hour diner.One night, a customer walked in and ordered some food.As she delivered it to him, she noticed that he had an abnormally large mouth, filled with rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth, and was cautiously preparing to take off running when he simply smiled and began to eat.But this story, too, ended with 'but that's a story for another day'.The man continued to scroll through the website, to see if any of the stories were complete.Instead, he saw story after story, each with excellent ratings, never knowing how they ended.Eventually, it became an obsession with him.Apparently, it had become an obsession with many others, because it seemed like daily the forum were filled with new comments of people begging for answers.Four years passed.The man no longer slept, only ate or interacted enough as to not lose his job or be evicted, and his mental health drastically declined.He hated the stories and what they had done to him.And just when he thought he was at his breaking point, he saw that another sequel had been posted.That was all he needed to send him over.Angrily, he clicked on the story to start reading, to see if this ended in ANY type of resolution.And as he read about how Jared, Amanda, and Malcolm found themselves in a sterile white room with no doors or windows in 'the final part' of the abandoned town story, he only felt despair build within him.He continued to read on as they grew weak with hunger and thirst, how they tried to claw at the walls until their nails broke off, how they even tried to eat their own flesh, only to have it grow back overnight.Until, finally, they starved to death.The end.A single tear ran down the man's face.Was this some kind of sick joke?No more stories.That was the last straw.No more stories would ruin his life.As he stood up, preparing to leave his apartment and never return, he noticed a small note taped to his front door.Curious, he walked over and picked it up.The note looked to have been printed from a computer, each letter slightly offset as if the ink was running dry or the printer was too old.It simply read:'that's a story for another day'.
