He didn't know he'd soon be a father to 6 illegitimate children, or he wouldn't have done it. Yesterday, Ann snapped and slit the throat of her toxic ex-husband. The neighbors walking by saw the whole thing through the window, but simply looked at each other, shrugged, and kept walking. Ann continued her day as usual, leaving the still warm body on her floor. She didn't know she would be arrested for murder, or she wouldn't have done it. Yesterday, Lacey took her husband and kids on a drive on the winding roads next to the ocean. Her hands shook as she gripped the wheel, while her kids sat oblivious in the back. She and her husband shared a meaningful look as she jerked the car to the right and into the crashing ocean waves. She didn't know she would be shunned while laying 6 ft. under, or she wouldn't have done it. Yesterday, the news was announced that an unsurvivable asteroid was headed straight to Earth.

Why am I in my house and why do I have a dictionary in front of me?'A disembodied voice responded, This is to give you the deliberate, focused practice you need.I figure English will be the easiest since you already speak it.'I'm sorry, I don't understand what's going on!

The first dozen reviews were pretty standard, but it was the last that caused me to bolt upright.The customer complained that the camera was on a time delay, sometimes as much as fifteen minutes.I went back to the video and pressed play with shaky fingers.I watched in horror as the man slithered under my bed, giving the camera a wink before disappearing in the darkness.Then I saw myself enter the room and climb in bed before the video ended.Now I'm sitting in my bed, knowing he's under it.I could call the police, but I doubt I'd have time….So please, do yourselves a favor and read the reviews."}]}
